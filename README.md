## Contributing

All contributions are welcome. This is a group effort, and even small contributions can make a difference.
Some tasks also don't require much knowledge to get started.  The best contribution that can be made, is playing the game and reporting bugs by opening a github issue on this repository.  Code contributions, as well as porting changes from the [upstream repo](https://github.com/zeldaret/oot) are greatly appreciated.

Most discussions happen on our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/8tktBEhbZm), where you are welcome to ask if you need help getting started, or if you have any questions regarding this project and other decompilation projects.
