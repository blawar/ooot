# Open Ocarina - The Master Port


```diff
- WARNING! -

This repository is a work in progress, and while it can be used to make certain changes, it's still
constantly evolving.

Currently assets are statically linked, however this is just until we get the game sorted.  Once its stable,
we will switch to an external asset loader.  Stability, 60 FPS, and external asset loading are the top priorities.

While it is playable in it's current state, if you are not interested in contributing, then you should
wait until the project is further along before playing it.  This is a development branch.  We need help
finding bugs and PR's for bug fixes and enhancements.

Only Visual Studio Debug 32-bit is currently supported.

Though most of the work for 64-bit is done, 32-bit is being buttoned up first.

32-bit Release works, but is buggy due to optimizations breaking many assumptions.
```

**Note: This repository does not include any of the assets necessary to build the ROM. A prior copy of the game is required to extract the needed assets. The required ROM is The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time PAL 1.0. Currently, the ROM must first be decompressed with a tool like [z64decompress](https://github.com/z64me/z64decompress). Once the ROM is decompressed its md5 checksum should be** ``39a70afa2a7eea1ea306c19e5fd1a8aa``**.**
 
**Note: Be sure to use ``git clone --recursive https://github.com/blawar/ooot.git`` when cloning the repo for the submodules.**
