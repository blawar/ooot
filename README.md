## Required Programs For Compiling Windows

[Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) **Add to path during the install**

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) **Choose x64 Build and Use the git bash to clone the repo and to run setup.py**

[Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) **During setup click C++ development**

## Installation

### Windows

**Visual Studio 2019+ is the only currently supported build environment, and only the 32-bit X86/WIN32 build**

You must use the ZAPD that is included with this repository, and not the main branch as it is modified.

### PAL 1.0 RETAIL ROM
If you are using the EUR PAL 1.0 retail rom,

**make Sure baserom_original.z64 or baserom_original.n64 is inside 
\ooot\roms\PAL_1.0\ If it's not the correct "hash_md5": ["c02c1d79679f7ceb9a3bde55fff8aa13"] it won't extract the assets and continue.**

Open Git Bash Type ``git clone --recursive https://github.com/blawar/ooot.git`` let it run.
After it's done type cd ooot and if you have the rom placed in the location above 
Run this command next to extract the assets from the rom (baserom_original.z64 must exist in the directory)

```
.\setup.py -b PAL_1.0
```

### EUR Masterquest Debug ROM
If you are using the EUR Master Quest Debug rom.

**make Sure baserom_original.z64 or baserom_original.n64 is inside 
\ooot\roms\EUR_MQD\ If it's not the correct "hash_md5": ["f0b7f35375f9cc8ca1b2d59d78e35405", "8ca71e87de4ce5e9f6ec916202a623e9", "f751d1a097764e2337b1ac9ba1e27699"], it won't extract the assets and continue.**

Open Git Bash Type ``git clone --recursive https://github.com/blawar/ooot.git`` let it run.
After it's done type cd ooot and if you have the rom placed in the location above 
Run this command next to extract the assets from the rom (baserom_original.z64 must exist in the directory)
```
.\setup.py -b EUR_MQD
```

Open OOT.sln, you will find this in \ooot\vs make sure **Debug - Win32** or **Release - Win32** is selected, then hit build.

Once the build completes, press F5 to start it if you are testing code but if you are compiling to play right click oot on the side and click build.

### macOS

Not currently supported, however a makefile and porting of GLideN64 would allow this and a PR is welcome.

### Linux (Native or under WSL / VM)
Linux does not currently work.  The below steps are for development purposes.

```
Debian/Ubuntu

sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt install libpng-dev
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install meson

Arch Linux

edit /etc/pacman.conf annd go to the bottom uncomment multilib so remove the # do not touch testing.

sudo pacman -S gcc lib32-gcc-libs
sudo pacman -S sdl2 lib32-sdl2
sudo pacman -S meson
sudo pacman -S python-pip
sudo pacman -S libpng

Fedora Linux

sudo dnf in gcc
sudo dnf in sdl2-devel
sudo dnf in meson
sudo dnf in python3-pip
sudo dnf in libpng

setup.py -b EUR_MQD
meson setup linux
cd linux
ninja
```
