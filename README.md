# Open Ocarina - The Master Port


```diff
- WARNING! -

This repository is a work in progress, and while it can be used to make certain changes, it's still
constantly evolving.

Currently assets are statically linked, however this is just until we get the game sorted.  Once its stable,
we will switch to an external asset loader.  Stability, 60 FPS, and external asset loading are the top priorities.

While it is playable in it's current state, if you are not interested in contributing, then you should
wait until the project is further along before playing it.  This is a development branch.  We need help
finding bugs and PR's for bug fixes and enhancements.

Though most of the work for 64-bit is done, 32-bit is being buttoned up first.
```

**Note: This repository does not include any of the assets necessary to build the ROM. A prior copy of the game is required to extract the needed assets.**

**Note: Be sure to use ``git clone --recursive https://github.com/blawar/ooot.git`` when cloning the repo for the submodules.**

## Installation

### Windows

**Visual Studio 2019+ is the only currently supported build environment, and only the 32-bit X86/WIN32 build**

You must use the ZAPD that is included with this repository, and not the main branch as it is modified.

### PAL 1.0 RETAIL ROM
If you are using the EUR PAL 1.0 retail rom, than place it at roms/PAL_1.0/baserom_original.z64

Run this command to extract the assets from the rom (baserom_original.z64 must exist in the directory)
```
setup.py -b PAL_1.0
```

### EUR Masterquest Debug ROM
If you are using the EUR Master Quest Debug rom, than place it at roms/EUR_MQD/baserom_original.z64

Run this command to extract the assets from the rom (baserom_original.z64 must exist in the directory)
```
setup.py -b EUR_MQD
```

Open vs/OOT.sln, make sure **Debug - Win32** or **Release - Win32** is selected, then hit build.

Once the build completes, press F5 to start it.

### macOS

Not currently supported, however a makefile and porting of GLideN64 would allow this and a PR is welcome.

### Linux (Native or under WSL / VM)

Not currently supported, however a makefile and porting of GLideN64 would allow this and a PR is welcome.
