# How To Help
Please help translate these text strings to other languages.  Please be very mindful of the formatting.

As of this time, we already have someone working on the spanish translations!

# Encoding
All characters must be UTF-8 encoded.  All characters are supported, not just latin characters.

# Creating New Translations
If you wish to create a new translation for a language not specified, copy message_data_en.h and replace "en" with the iso language code you wish to translate, then edit the file and submit a PR or send the file to me.

You will also need to translate the corresponding json files for your language.

Right-to-left languages such as Arabic and Hebrew are not supported.
